## 🔭 What I Do

- **⚙️ Analog & Mixed-Signal IC Design**  
  • Design and simulation of MEMS microphone front-end circuits, amplifiers, and biasing networks.  
  • Layout design, DRC/LVS verification, and post-layout simulation using SkyWater 130 nm PDK.  
  • Hands-on experience with **Xschem**, **Ngspice**, **Magic VLSI**, **Netgen**, and **LTspice**.  
  • Focus on **low-noise**, **low-power**, and **area-efficient** analog architectures.  
  • Exposure to analog building blocks like op-amps, comparators, current mirrors, differential pairs, and ADC front-ends.

- **💡 Digital VLSI / RTL Design**  
  • Development of synthesizable Verilog modules and testbenches for digital systems.  
  • Projects include **Traffic Light Controller**, **Vending Machine**, **Digital Lock**, and **4-bit ALU**.  
  • Understanding of RTL-to-GDSII flow, timing analysis, FSM design, and digital system verification.  
  • Familiar with tools such as **Vivado**, **Icarus Verilog (iVerilog)**, and **Yosys** for simulation and synthesis.  
  • Strong foundation in **Combinational and Sequential Circuits**, **Counters**, **Shift Registers**, and **FSM Design**.

- **🤖 Embedded Systems & IoT Development**  
  • Design of **ESP32** and **Arduino-based** smart systems integrating multiple sensors and actuators.  
  • Developed a **Dual Ultrasonic Sensor Obstacle Avoidance Robot** with servo scanning radar.  
  • Implementation of **IoT-based Monitoring Systems** (Baby Monitor, Fire Detection, Environmental Sensing).  
  • Integration with **Blynk Cloud** and **MQTT** for real-time data visualization and control.  
  • Power management and regulation circuits using **IC7805** and Li-ion batteries.

- **🔬 System Integration & PCB Design**  
  • Circuit schematic design and PCB layout using **KiCad** and **EasyEDA**.  
  • Mixed-domain prototyping combining analog signal processing with digital control logic.  
  • Emphasis on modular design for easy debugging and scalability.

- **📊 Simulation, Analysis & Verification**  
  • Simulation of analog/digital systems with waveform analysis, frequency response, and transient behavior.  
  • Post-layout verification and performance optimization of ICs and system prototypes.  
  • Familiar with data visualization tools and hardware debugging instruments like DSO, logic analyzer, and multimeter.
