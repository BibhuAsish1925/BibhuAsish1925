# 👋 Hi, I’m Bibhu Asish Panda  

**an aspiring Electronics and Communication Engineer passionate about Digital VLSI Design, Verification, and Embedded Hardware Systems.
With a strong foundation in Verilog, FSM-based modeling, and digital system simulation, I enjoy building circuits that bridge logic design with real-world applications.

I have hands-on experience with EDA tools such as Vivado, Xschem, Ngspice, and LTspice, and I’m skilled in both digital and analog design flows — from Verilog RTL modeling to transistor-level circuit analysis using SkyWater 130 nm CMOS.

I am driven by curiosity and precision, aiming to contribute to the fields of Digital Design, ASIC Verification, and Mixed-Signal IC Development, while continuously exploring embedded automation and IoT integration.**
